Author: Megan Hessel

## Purpose 
This repository attempts to understand how FEMA National Risk Index scores for counties in California compare to those in other states through data visualization. 

## File Structure 
Data visualization is accomplished within the `HW2.qmd` which is located in the root. The `HW2.qmd` finalized data visualizations are saved as pngs in the `fig` folder. Also in the root is the README and an unpolished, preliminary data exploration and visualization quarto document called `HW2_draft.qmd`. There is **no** data within this repository.
